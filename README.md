## What is Pocket Diagnoser?

To diagnose chronic diseases early in order to improve survival and efficiency of 
treatment, I developed Intelligent Diagnosis. The application is equipped with multiple 
Machine Learning models for:
● Accurate, Quick and Early diagnosis of Breast Cancer, Heart Attack and Heart 
Failure using information regarding their lifestyle and the levels of a few hormones 
in their body from blood tests. Using this information, these diseases can be 
diagnosed even before the person starts showing symptoms thus preventing any 
damage being inflicted onto the person.
● Also, diagnosing Breast cancer, Brain Tumor and Dementia using Mammogram and 
Brain MRI Scan. The models are trained to be able to diagnose the diseases even in 
their early stages which can be overlooked many a times while manually diagnosing 
the scans.
● These models are aimed at Diagnosing diseases at early stages before the 
appearance of symptoms, reducing the errors that occur during diagnosis and also 
to minimize the number of false negative results.
